# Release notes

April 13, 2018

This archive with precompiled Windows DLLs for SQLite3 contains
experimental versions with enabled ICU support, in addition to the
versions without ICU support.

The required ICU DLLs are not included in this archive; they have
to be downloaded from

https://www.npcglib.org/~stathis/blog/precompiled-icu

ICU support for SQLite3 is based on the pre-built ICU Libraries v59.1.
These are compiled for 32/64-bit Windows, using Visual Studio 2015.

When using the ICU DLLs you may need to specify an environment variable
ICU_DATA pointing to the data folder, where the icudtXXl.dat file lives
(e.g. set ICU_DATA=F:\icu\data).
